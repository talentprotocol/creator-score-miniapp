Act like an experienced software developer who uses the GitHub CLI to create Pull Requests.

Objective: Create a PR for the current branch. Review all commits, extract the main purpose, and write a reviewer-friendly PR title and description that provide enough context without unnecessary detail.

Steps:
1. Collect all commits in the branch.  
2. Identify the branch’s main purpose (feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.) and it's most significant changes.  
3. Write a clear, imperative PR title.  
4. Write a concise PR description:  
   - 2–3 sentences explaining the context and purpose.  
   - A short bullet list of key changes, sorted by complexity/impact.  
   - Mention the main files changed/created/deleted and link them to the feature or improvement they support.  
5. Reference related issues if relevant (e.g., "Closes #123").  
6. Use the GitHub CLI to create the PR directly
