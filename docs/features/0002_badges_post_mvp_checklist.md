## üìù Notes
- **Priority order**: Phase 2 (Platform Badges) should be completed first as it unblocks the full badge experience
- **Dependencies**: Public routes (Phase 3) depend on platform badges being complete
- **Testing**: Each phase should include comprehensive testing before moving to the next
- **User feedback**: Collect user feedback throughout implementation to guide feature priorities
- **Performance**: Monitor performance impact of each new feature and optimize as needed
